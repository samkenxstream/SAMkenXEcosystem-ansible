minor_changes:
  - Removed ``exclude`` and ``recursive-exclude`` commands for generated files from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file.
    These excludes were unnecessary since releases are expected to be built with a clean worktree.
  - Removed ``exclude`` commands for sanity test files from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file.
    These tests were previously excluded because they did not pass when run from an sdist.
    However, sanity tests are not expected to pass from an sdist, so excluding some (but not all) of the failing tests makes little sense.
  - Removed redundant ``include`` commands from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file.
    These includes either duplicated default behavior or another command.
  - Use ``include`` where ``recursive-include`` is unnecessary in the ``MANIFEST.in`` file.
