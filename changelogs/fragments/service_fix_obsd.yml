bugfixes:

  - service module, enable/disable is not a exclusive action in checkmode anymore.
breaking_changes:
  - service module will not permanently configure variables/flags for openbsd when doing enable/disable operation anymore,
    this module was never meant to do this type of work, just to manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config or similar
    module should be created and used instead.
