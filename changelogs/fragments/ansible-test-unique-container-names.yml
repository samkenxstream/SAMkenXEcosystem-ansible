bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - All containers created by ansible-test now include the current test session ID in their name.
                   This avoids conflicts between concurrent ansible-test invocations using the same container host.
breaking_changes:
  - ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing running containers.
                   The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
